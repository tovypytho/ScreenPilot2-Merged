/**
 * Thread-safe barrier that gates fresh-frame capture to post-hide frames only.
 *
 * Avoids cross-clock timestamp comparisons (Image.timestamp vs
 * SystemClock.elapsedRealtimeNanos) that fail on some Vivo / MediaTek vendor
 * devices where the two clocks use different sources.
 *
 * Usage inside captureScreen():
 *  1. Call [snapshot] to record the current generation (before hiding overlays).
 *  2. Register the ImageReader listener.
 *  3. On Dispatchers.Main.immediate: hide overlays, then call [advance].
 *  4. In the listener: call [isPostHide] with the snapshot — accept the frame only
 *     when it returns true.
 *  5. Optionally attempt an immediate post-hide drain via [isPostHide] for static
 *     screens where no new frame will arrive.
 *
 * Every extracted abstraction must be used by ScreenCaptureService in production.
